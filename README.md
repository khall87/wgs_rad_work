#### Radiation whole-genome sequencing work 
This project contains support utilities, results, and the workflow to perform 
my analysis of our radiation induced tumor sequencing data. 
The methods include SNV filtration and analysis, indel filtration and 
analysis, copy-number estimation, filtration and analysis, and finally 
rearrangement filtration and analysis. It is intended both as a public 
resource for the utilities used in the analysis, as well as a reproducible
record of the work.
